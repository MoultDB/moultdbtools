Description: The NCBI taxonomy is a popular resource for taxonomic studies but it only contains
    data on species with sequence data whereas the GBIF has a more extensive coverage of
    extinct species. Taxonbridge is useful for the creation and analysis of custom taxonomies
    based on the NCBI taxonomy and GBIF backbone taxonomy.
